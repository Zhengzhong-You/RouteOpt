# RouteOpt

---

## Note:

- RouteOpt solves the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) and the vehicle routing problem with time windows (
  VRPTW). Please cite our paper [_Two-Stage Learning to Branch in Branch-Price-and-Cut
  Algorithms for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems
  Exactly_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374553305_Two-Stage_Learning_to_Branch_in_Branch-Price-and-Cut_Algorithms_for_Solving_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_Exactly)
  if you use RouteOpt for your research.

- RouteOpt for *academic* use only.

1. The solver consists of the following modules:
    1. **Default Setting (Setting I)**: Full-fledged version with all functionalities enabled, offering the best overall
       performance.
    2. **Setting II**: For comparing different branching strategies.
    3. **Setting for open instances**: Requires access to supercomputing resources. Detailed explanations of these
       features can be found in
       our [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374553305_Two-Stage_Learning_to_Branch_in_Branch-Price-and-Cut_Algorithms_for_Solving_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_Exactly).
       For specific usage, please refer to the [User Manual](https://github.com/Zhengzhong-You/RouteOpt-usermanual).

2. RouteOpt employs a novel two-stage learning-to-branch module. The current parameter configuration is suitable for
   most instances, except for ones where pricing is extremely challenging (e.g., CVRP instances with long routes). For
   such instances, the parameters need to be adjusted according to our recommendations in
   the [User Manual](https://github.com/Zhengzhong-You/RouteOpt-usermanual).

3. The VRPTW module of RouteOpt is currently optimized for solving type-2 instances (ones with very loose capacity
   constraints) fast, and is not suitable for type-1 instances. This is due to the adaptive strategies mentioned
   in [Bucket Graph](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.2020.0985).

4. The workflow design, computational techniques, and output style of RouteOpt pay a high tribute
   to [VRPSolver](https://vrpsolver.math.u-bordeaux.fr/). We are deeply grateful for Drs. Artur Pessoa, Ruslan Sadykov,
   Eduardo Uchoa, Fran√ßois Vanderbeck, and others who have contributed to the VRPSolver. Special thanks go to Dr. Ruslan
   Sadykov for providing us access to the VRPSolver and helping us tune it. Without the VRPSolver, RouteOpt would not
   have been possible.

## Requirements

---

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) version 3.16 or higher (required).
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) version 3.4.0 or higher (required).
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html) version 1.4.2 or higher (required).
- [GUROBI](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-software/) version 10.0 or higher (recommended).
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/users/download/) version 1.76.0 or higher (recommended).
- [CVRPSEP](https://github.com/Zhengzhong-You/cvrpsep) (recommend this revised
  fork: https://github.com/Zhengzhong-You/cvrpsep). The original
  is https://econ.au.dk/research/researcher-websites/jens-lysgaard/cvrpsep/.
- [HGS](https://github.com/Zhengzhong-You/hgs) (recommend this revised fork: https://github.com/Zhengzhong-You/hgs). The
  original is https://github.com/vidalt/HGS-CVRP. (This is optional for getting good UBs for CVRP instances)

Please ensure these requirements are met before proceeding with the following steps.

## Link Depencices

---

**Step 1:** Clone the RouteOpt repository:

```
https://github.com/Zhengzhong-You/pub-RouteOpt.git
```

**Step 2:** Construct the project directory tree:

```
cd pub-RouteOpt && mkdir Zips Dependency && cd Dependency
```

**Step 3:** Build the cvrpsep library:

```
(obtain the code) && cd cvrpsep
make
```

**Step 4:** Download Eigen:

```
cd ../
wget https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.4.0/eigen-3.4.0.zip
unzip eigen-3.4.0.zip && mv eigen-3.4.0.zip ../Zips
```

**Step 4.5:** Build the hgs library (optional): follow the instructions in https://github.com/Zhengzhong-You/hgs.
Uncomment the corresponding lines in `CMakeLists.txt` to enable the hgs library.

**Step 5:** Set the `GUROBI_HOME` environment variable :

On Linux, use `vim ~/.bashrc`. On MacOS, use `vim ~/.bash_profile` to open the corresponding file. Then add the
following line to it.

```
export GUROBI_HOME=<gurobi_root>/<gurobi_version>/<OS>
```

Example: `export GUROBI_HOME=${HOME}/gurobi1000/linux64`

After that, use `source ~/.bashrc`
or `source ~/.bash_profile` to reload the update file.

**Step 6:** Revise `FindGUROBI.cmake`:

It's located in `<path to solver>/pub-RouteOpt/Application/CVRP/CVRP/package`

```
find_library(<package>_LIBRARY
        NAMES <lib>
        PATHS "$ENV{<package>_HOME}/lib"
        )
```

Replace the `<lib>` with the right `lib`.

For example, if you use `gurobi1000`, the lib will be `libgurobi100.so` on Linux and `libgurobi100.dylib` on MacOS.

**Step 7:** Revise `CMakeLists.txt`:

Revise path of Boost Library in the CMakeLists.txt.

## Useage

---

The library accepts two kinds of parameters: (RouteOpt_VRPTW for VRPTW)

1. Use the `idx/<ins_file.ins>` (Recommended)

   ```
   ./CVRP -d idx/<ins_file.ins> -n -u
   ```

   In this command, `-d` is followed by `.ins` file, and `-n` gets the instance name in the `n`-th line of
   the file. Note that `-u` is an optional parameter to provide an initial upper bound (UB) if a valid one is available.

For instance, you can type in:

   ```
   ./CVRP -d idx/<ins file>.ins -n 0 -u 1000
   ```

This command will read the instance from the `0`-th line of the `.ins` file with the initial UB as 1000.

Note that, if the `.ins` file contains a UB, it will be automatically read from the file, and the UB provided by -u will
be ignored. The `.ins` files in idx folder now all contain a UB (optimal value). For instance, you can type in:

   ```
   ./CVRP -d idx/cvrp_200_200_opt.ins -n 0
   ```

2. Specify the complete path

   ```
   ./CVRP ./../../../DataForCVRP/BML/200_200/CVRP_200_154.vrp -u 30972.0
   ```
