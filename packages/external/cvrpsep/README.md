# cvrpsep

This is my own "fork" of the [GitHub - sassoftware/cvrpsep: The CVRPSEP package is a collection of routines, written in the C++ programming language, for separation of various classes of cuts in branch-and-cut algorithms for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem.](https://github.com/sassoftware/cvrpsep)(first fork), which is also the "fork" of the CVRPSEP package for separation algorithms for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem which is hosted at https://econ.au.dk/research/researcher-websites/jens-lysgaard/cvrpsep/. (original)

Somehow, using the these two repositories ("first fork" and "original") directly will lead to some issues, so I made my own, bascially, I use all cpps in the "first fork" and all hpps in "original".
